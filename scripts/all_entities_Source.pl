would retrieve all entities of type Source and include all fields
in the entities in the output.

=head2 Related entities

The Source entity has the following relationship links:

=over 4
    
=item Asserts Identifier

=item Formulated CoregulatedSet

=item HasCompoundAliasFrom Compound

=item HasReactionAliasFrom Reaction

=item Imported Identifier

=item Provided Subsystem
