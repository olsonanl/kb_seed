=head1 proteins_to_roles

Example:

    proteins_to_roles [arguments] < input > output

The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line
is a tab-separated set of fields).  Normally, the last field in each
line would contain the identifer. If another column contains the identifier
use

    -c N

where N is the column (from 1) that contains the subsystem.

This is a pipe command. The input is taken from the standard input, and the
output is to the standard output.

=head2 Documentation for underlying call

This script is a wrapper for the CDMI-API call proteins_to_roles. It is documented as follows:

  $return = $obj->proteins_to_roles($proteins)

=over 4

=item Parameter and return types

=begin html

<pre>
$proteins is a proteins
$return is a reference to a hash where the key is a protein and the value is a roles
proteins is a reference to a list where each element is a protein
protein is a string
roles is a reference to a list where each element is a role
role is a string

</pre>

=end html

=begin text

$proteins is a proteins
$return is a reference to a hash where the key is a protein and the value is a roles

=item -c Column

This is used only if the column containing the subsystem is not the last column.

=item -i InputFile    [ use InputFile, rather than stdin ]

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with extra columns added.

Input lines that cannot be extended are written to stderr.
